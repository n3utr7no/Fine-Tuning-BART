# Fine-Tuning-BART

If you view the scores at the end of the notebook, you will see that the fine tuned barely performed better, thats because for fine tuning extensive reaources and time is required, which I didnt wasnt able to arrange. If given enough data and time to train, fine tuning generally gives a boost in the performance.
